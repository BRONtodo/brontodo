# TodoMVC GitHub Notifications

By Brian Ray & Ronald Kinch.

## Description
The source provided a functioning todo list with all CRUD.
It uses the Windows.localStorage to persist the todo list.

Our implementation is to start the JavaScript with asking the user for
 their token. We then use an ajax GET to pre-load the localStorage with
 the users GitHub notifications (title and id).

The next step use an ajax POST to send updates to GitHub where the
 source saves to the localStorage.
